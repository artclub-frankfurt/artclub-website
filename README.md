# Tsering — Student Association Website

A simple static site for a student association. Wraps Instagram, Luma, and a Google Form into a small set of editable pages.

## 1. What this is

- **Home** — short intro, latest Instagram posts (carousel), upcoming events, "Join us" form button.
- **Events** — index page plus a detail page per event, with a registration button to Luma and a photo grid (Instagram embeds) added after the event.
- **About** — free-form prose page.
- **Contact** — email and social links.

The site is fully static. There is no login, no database, no backend.

## 2. Tech stack & why

| Area | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Astro 6.x | Best SSG for content-heavy sites; great markdown support; ships almost zero JS. |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 | Utility-first; fast iteration; well-audited; no design-system overhead. |
| Hosting | Vercel | Free tier covers our use; deploys on `git push`; supports apex domains via plain DNS records (no nameserver migration needed). |
| Repo | GitHub | The github.com web editor is the editor's primary content tool. |
| Package manager | pnpm | Default standard; supported by Vercel. |
| Site config | JSON + Zod | Native TS JSON import (no parser dep); validated at build time. |

Alternatives considered: Next.js (heavier, app-oriented), Hugo (less ergonomic for embeds), **Cloudflare Pages** (rejected — would have required moving DNS off Strato to Cloudflare for apex-domain support, with risk to the existing Zoho email setup; functionally equivalent for our use case), Decap CMS (rejected — adds maintenance surface for marginal UX gain on a mostly-read-only site), YAML for site config (rejected — would add `js-yaml` for marginal editor UX gain on an "almost-never-edited" file).

## 2.1 Security & dependency policy

This site follows a strict-by-default dependency posture:

- **Exact pinning.** No `^` or `~` in `package.json`. `.npmrc` enforces `save-exact=true` so `pnpm add` always writes pinned versions.
- **Locked transitive deps.** `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed.
- **Minimal direct deps.** Total: `astro`, `@tailwindcss/vite`, `tailwindcss` (runtime); `vitest` (dev only). Nothing exotic.
- **No runtime third-party JS via npm.** External JS comes from two `<script>` tags loaded by URL: behold.so on the home page, Instagram `embed.js` on event detail pages with photos. Both render gracefully if the script fails (carousel hidden / "View on Instagram" link fallback).
- **Upgrades are explicit.** To bump a dep, run `pnpm update <name> --latest`, review the changelog, run `pnpm test && pnpm build`, then commit with the version change in the message.

## 4. Local dev

Prerequisites: Node 22+, pnpm 9+.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:4321
pnpm build        # production build into ./dist
pnpm test         # run unit tests (vitest)
```

## 4.1 Code contribution workflow (for devs)

The `main` branch is **protected**: direct pushes are rejected. Code changes go through pull requests merged by the repo owner. This is required because Vercel's Hobby plan only deploys commits authored by the team owner — the PR-merge flow ensures every commit on `main` is authored by the merger.

### Daily workflow

```bash
# 1. Branch off main
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b feat/short-description     # or fix/, chore/, docs/

# 2. Work, commit
# ...
git add <files>
git commit -m "type: short imperative summary"

# 3. Push the branch
git push -u origin feat/short-description

# 4. Open a PR
gh pr create --fill                          # uses last commit message as title/body
# OR open the URL printed by `git push` in a browser

# 5. Repo owner reviews and clicks "Squash and merge"
#    (Vercel auto-deploys the squash-merged commit ~30 sec later)

# 6. Pull main, delete local branch
git checkout main && git pull
git branch -d feat/short-description
```

### Important: how to merge

When merging a PR, the repo owner **must use "Squash and merge"** (not "Create a merge commit", and not "Rebase and merge"). Reason: only squash produces a head commit on `main` authored by the person clicking merge — which is what Vercel's Hobby plan checks before deploying. The other merge modes preserve the original PR author and Vercel will refuse the deploy.

If you ever upgrade to Vercel Pro (or move hosting to Cloudflare Pages / Netlify), this constraint goes away and any merge mode is fine.

### Note for content editors (non-devs)

This PR workflow only applies to **code changes**. Editing markdown content via github.com (Section 6) commits directly to `main` and triggers a deploy without a PR — that's the intended flow for the editor.

## 5. Deploy

### One-time setup (Vercel)

1. Push the repo to GitHub (already done).
2. <https://vercel.com/signup> → "Continue with GitHub". Authorize Vercel to access the `Tseringw` org / your account.
3. **Add New → Project** → import `Tseringw/artclub-website`. Vercel auto-detects Astro; leave the defaults:
   - Build command: `pnpm build` (auto)
   - Output directory: `dist` (auto)
   - Install command: `pnpm install` (auto)
4. **Deploy.** First build takes ~2 min. You get a live URL like `https://artclub-website.vercel.app`.

### Custom domain (DNS stays at Strato; Zoho email untouched)

1. Project → **Settings → Domains** → add `artclub-frankfurt.de`.
2. Vercel shows the DNS records to add at Strato:
   - `A` record, name `@`, value `76.76.21.21`
   - `CNAME` record, name `www`, value `cname.vercel-dns.com`
3. At Strato (`strato.de` → Customer Service → Domainverwaltung → DNS-Verwaltung): add **only those two records**. Leave everything else (especially MX and TXT/SPF/DKIM for Zoho) exactly as-is.
4. Vercel auto-provisions HTTPS in ~5 min and verifies the domain.
5. Smoke-test: `curl -I https://artclub-frankfurt.de` returns 200; send a test email to `info@artclub-frankfurt.de` to confirm Zoho still receives it.

### Updates

Push to `main` → Vercel rebuilds in ~30 seconds. Branches and PRs get preview deploys automatically.

### Rollback

Vercel dashboard → project → **Deployments** → click any prior deployment → **Promote to Production**.

## 6. Content editing guide (for non-devs)

All content is edited on github.com. You don't need to install anything.

### Edit an existing page

1. Go to the repo on github.com.
2. Click into `src/content/site/` → click the file you want to edit (e.g. `about.md`).
3. Click the pencil icon.
4. Edit the text. Anything between `---` lines at the top is structured data (don't change the field names). Below that, use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for headings, lists, links, etc.
5. Scroll to the bottom → "Commit changes…" → write a short message → "Commit changes".
6. Wait ~30 seconds, then refresh the live site.

### Add a new event

1. Go to `src/content/events/` on github.com → "Add file" → "Create new file".
2. Name it like `2026-09-15-autumn-mixer.md` (date prefix keeps the folder organized; the URL slug comes from the full filename minus `.md`).
3. Paste this template and fill it in:

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "Your Event Title"
   date: 2026-09-15
   lumaUrl: "https://lu.ma/your-luma-event-id"
   ---

   The full description of your event goes here. You can use multiple
   paragraphs, **bold**, *italic*, [links](https://example.com), and lists:

   - one
   - two
   ```

4. Commit. The event appears on the site within ~30 seconds.

### Add post-event photos

1. After the event, post the photos to Instagram as usual.
2. For each photo (or carousel), copy its Instagram URL (e.g. `https://www.instagram.com/p/ABCDE/`).
3. On github.com, open the event's `.md` file → click the pencil icon.
4. Add an `instagramPosts:` list in the frontmatter (between the `---` lines):
   ```yaml
   instagramPosts:
     - "https://www.instagram.com/p/ABCDE/"
     - "https://www.instagram.com/p/FGHIJ/"
   ```
5. Commit. Photos appear on the event detail page within ~30 seconds.

### Change site config

`src/data/site.json` holds site-wide settings: email, social links, Google Form URL, behold widget ID. Edit on github.com the same way.

**JSON syntax rules (different from markdown):**
- Every key must be in `"double quotes"`.
- Strings must be in `"double quotes"`.
- No comments (lines starting with `//` or `#`) — JSON does not allow them.
- No trailing commas after the last item in an object or array.
- If you break these rules, the next deploy will fail with a clear error message naming the field and the problem. Just fix and re-commit.

**Field reference:**
- `siteName` — site name shown in the header and tab title.
- `tagline` — short phrase used near the hero (optional in design).
- `contactEmail` — primary email; appears in footer and contact page.
- `googleFormUrl` — full URL of the Google Form for membership signup.
- `beholdWidgetId` — the widget ID from your behold.so dashboard. While set to `"REPLACE_ME"`, the home page shows a placeholder instead of the carousel.
- `socialLinks.instagram` — full URL to the association's Instagram profile.
- `socialLinks.email` — same as `contactEmail` (kept separate so social blocks can reference it as a "social link").

## 7. Integrations reference

| Service | What it does | Where it's configured | How to swap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **behold.so** | Instagram carousel on the home page | `beholdWidgetId` in `src/data/site.json`; widget script in `src/components/InstagramCarousel.astro` | Replace the script + data attribute with snapwidget.com (or similar) markup. One file. |
| **Instagram embeds** | Per-event photo grids | `instagramPosts:` array in each event's frontmatter | N/A — Instagram-native |
| **Luma** | Event registration | `lumaUrl` in each event's frontmatter | N/A — just swap the URL |
| **Google Form** | Membership signup | `googleFormUrl` in `src/data/site.json` | Swap the URL |
| **Vercel** | Hosting + CI/CD | Vercel dashboard | Move to Cloudflare Pages or Netlify: connect repo, set build command `pnpm build`, output dir `dist`. (For CF Pages on apex `artclub-frankfurt.de`: requires moving DNS to Cloudflare too.) |
| **Strato** | Domain registrar + DNS host | DNS records in Strato Domainverwaltung; `A @ → 76.76.21.21` and `CNAME www → cname.vercel-dns.com` point at Vercel | Move DNS to another provider by exporting/replicating records. |
| **Zoho Mail** | Email at `info@artclub-frankfurt.de` | MX + SPF/DKIM/DMARC TXT records at Strato | N/A — keep DNS records in place; Zoho is independent of the website host. |

## 8. Common maintenance tasks

- **Change contact email:** edit `contactEmail` and `socialLinks.email` in `src/data/site.json`.
- **Swap the Instagram widget service:** edit `src/components/InstagramCarousel.astro`. Replace the `<div>` + `<script>` with the new service's snippet. Update `site.json` if the widget ID format changes.
- **Add a new top-level page (e.g. `/sponsors`):**
  1. Create `src/content/site/sponsors.md` with frontmatter + body.
  2. Create `src/pages/sponsors.astro` mirroring `about.astro`.
  3. Add a link to the new page in the nav inside `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`.
- **Change the domain:** update `site:` in `astro.config.mjs`, then attach the new domain in Vercel (Settings → Domains) and add the corresponding DNS records at the new domain's registrar.
- **Disable an event temporarily:** delete the event's `.md` file (keep the `.md` somewhere else if you'll restore it).

## 9. Troubleshooting

- **Build fails on Vercel but works locally:** check the Node version (Vercel → Settings → General → Node.js version; set to 22.x or higher).
- **Deploy stuck "in progress":** trigger a new deploy from the dashboard, or push an empty commit (`git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger deploy"`).
- **Custom domain stuck on "Invalid Configuration":** verify in the Strato DNS panel that the `A @ 76.76.21.21` and `CNAME www cname.vercel-dns.com` records are present and that no conflicting `A`/`AAAA` records remain on `@` or `www`. DNS changes can take up to 30 min to propagate.
- **Email at `info@artclub-frankfurt.de` not arriving after deploy:** verify Zoho's MX records are still in Strato's DNS panel (typically `mx.zoho.eu`/`mx2.zoho.eu`/`mx3.zoho.eu`, or `mx.zoho.com` for US accounts). The Vercel setup should not have touched these — only added two new records.
- **Instagram embeds show only "View on Instagram" links:** Instagram's `embed.js` failed to load (rate-limited, blocked, or post is private). Refresh; if persistent, the post may be from a private account.
- **behold widget shows nothing:** check `beholdWidgetId` in `site.json` matches the ID in the behold dashboard, and that the connected Instagram account has at least one public post.
- **Frontmatter validation error in build log:** check that the event's frontmatter matches the schema in `src/content.config.ts` — `date` must be a valid date, `lumaUrl` must be a valid URL.
